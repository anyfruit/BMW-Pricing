# BMWPricing

This is a repository for MA575 Linear Models' course project: An Investigation into factors affecting BWM auction price at 2008. This is an in-depth analysis into finding factors that contribute the most and effective to predict the price of second-handed BMW cars. Example variables are model key, car type, and fuel type. During analysis, we applied strategies such as LASSO variable selection, weighted least squares, and various diagnostic methods to strength the effectiveness of the final model.
